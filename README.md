# SpotifyWebtasks

The task will display the new releases albums in spotify, if you click on the album you will be referenced to spotify site.

1. Please put index.html and styles.css in the same folder.
2. getNewReleases.js is actually the webtask code.

* Comment - the getAlbum function wasn't used in the index.html
